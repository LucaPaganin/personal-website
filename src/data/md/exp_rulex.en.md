Within the software development team, I mainly handle messaging between the
microservices that make up the application, the exposed REST API, and DevOps activities, such as building and
maintaining the software's continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, deployment, and testing
of the platform's cloud.

I primarily develop in Python and have gained experience using Azure DevOps Pipelines for
building CI/CD pipelines. I also work with JavaScript, although to a lesser extent,
mainly for maintaining the Electron application underlying the Rulex Software Platform. In
cloud maintenance, I use tools like Terraform and Kubernetes.
