During my PhD within the Euclid collaboration (ESA space mission),
my research focused on two main areas:

1.  **Spectroscopic Simulations:** Production and analysis of detailed simulations of the images
    that will be acquired by the NISP (Near-Infrared Spectro-Photometer) instrument aboard Euclid.
    This work is crucial for understanding and calibrating the instrument and preparing the data
    analysis pipelines.
2.  **Cosmological Forecasts (6x2pt analysis):** Development and application of advanced statistical methods
    ("6x2pt" analysis, combining 6 different two-point correlations between weak lensing, galaxy clustering,
    and cross-correlations) to make accurate predictions about Euclid's sensitivity in measuring
    fundamental cosmological parameters, such as those related to the nature of dark energy and dark matter.

This work required intensive use of Python, data analysis and simulation tools, and collaboration
in an international scientific context. I had the opportunity to develop my technical skills, including:

* programming in Python;
* use of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) including PyCharm and Visual Studio Code;
* use of source control systems like Git and GitLab;
* use of various UNIX operating systems;
* bash scripting;
* use of Docker containers.

The thesis topics were judged as innovative and relevant, and the methodologies employed were
recognized as thoroughly tested with deep attention to detail.
